Microbiology is the scientific study of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microscopic life forms. It involves the analysis of their structure, function, growth, evolution, classification, and interactions with the environment and living organisms. Microbiologists use various techniques such as microscopy, molecular biology, and biochemical assays to understand the behavior and properties of these microorganisms. The field has numerous applications in medicine, agriculture, industry, and environmental science, including the development of new treatments for diseases, improved crop yields, and effective waste management systems.
