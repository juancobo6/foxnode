# Foxnode ðŸ¦Š

**Foxnode** is a web-based application designed to create custom **Mermaid diagrams** based on user prompts. By harnessing the power of local **LLM models** with **Ollama** and **LangChain**, Foxnode offers a private, efficient, and interactive way to generate flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more using **LLama3.2:3b**. This project is tailored for developers, analysts, and project managers looking to visualize concepts through diagrams without compromising data security by using local model inference.

## Demo

Sample prompt:

`The Lean Startup method is an approach to developing new businesses and products that focuses on rapidly building and testing ideas with real customers to learn and adapt quickly. Rather than investing heavily in a fully-formed product, startups create a "minimum viable product" (MVP) with just enough features to attract early adopters. By gathering feedback, analyzing what works and what doesnâ€™t, and iterating based on this data, they aim to minimize waste, reduce the risk of failure, and make informed decisions about scaling or pivoting. This cycle of build-measure-learn helps startups efficiently refine their offerings to meet market needs.`

## Features

- **Web-based Interface**: Access the app directly through your browser.
- **Natural Language to Diagram**: Simply describe the diagram you need, and Foxnode interprets your prompt to generate the appropriate Mermaid syntax.
- **Local Model Inference**: Utilizes the LLama3.2:3b model for efficient and private language processing.
- **Powered by Ollama and LangChain**: Efficiently integrates model inference with dynamic prompt engineering for high-quality results.
